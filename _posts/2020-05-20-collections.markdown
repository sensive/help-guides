**Collections are an easy way to group, organize, present, and reference your assets.** An agency might collect mood boards to guide their research process,  while a UI designer might use a Collection to deliver downloadable assets organized by format.

**Unlike folders on your computer, you can contain the same asset across multiple Collections**, making it easier to avoid duplicate files and consolidating conversation in a single stream.

**Tasks can reference single files or entire Collections**
