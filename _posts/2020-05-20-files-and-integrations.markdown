Sensive allows you to **upload files directly from your computer** or import them from design tools such as **Figma or Sketch** via our integrations.

After uploading a file, it appears listed under the Files tab. Opening a file reveals additional options to collaborate with your team. **Use Annotations to highlight a region** of a file, and **@mention one of your teammates**.

You can organize files via **Collections**, and even reference them from Tasks via Attachments.
